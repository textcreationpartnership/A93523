            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe it hath been alwaies held very dangerous, both for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Prince, and peace of the people, to reſtore the children of powerfull Traitors, to their Fathers Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or Eſtates; which experience demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be too true in the <hi>Gowries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The reſtoring of this Family is in a ſpecial manner moſt dangerous, by reaſon of the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and vaſt bounds of the Eſtate of <hi>Argyle</hi> in the High-lands, the great Claim, many Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and Tenants that depend on it; all, or for
<pb facs="tcp:151737:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 61 -->the much greater part, ill principled, and inured to Rebellion theſe laſt 20 years, who blindly follow their Maſters commands, without any regard of their duty to God or the King. So that it is a moſt fit place to be the Neſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Rebellion, as it proved in the late <hi>Argyle</hi>'s time, to the great prejudice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſervice, &amp; ruine of many loyal Subjects. And this ſame very reaſon was brought by the late <hi>Argyle,</hi> againſt the <hi>Marqueſs of Antrum,</hi> to diſpoſſeſſe him of the Lordſhip of <hi>Kentyre,</hi> which he had purchaſed with the conſent of his late Majeſty. For he pretended that it was dangerous to ſuffer the ſaid <hi>Marqueſs of Antrum</hi> to enjoy theſe Lands, by reaſon of the great power of the Family of the <hi>Macdonalds;</hi> and of the bad conſequences that uſually follow the reſtoring of perſons to an Eſtate, which they had formerly loſt by forfeiture. But it's evident to all men, that this Reaſon is much more forcible againſt <hi>Argyle</hi> himſelf, and his Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's directly againſt the Council and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Modern <hi>Solomon</hi> K. <hi>James</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Grandfather, of bleſſed memory, who in his <hi>Baſilicon doron</hi> ſpeaks thus to his Son,<note place="margin">Baſil. dor. Book <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>As for the matter of Forfeitures, which are alſo done
<pb facs="tcp:151737:3"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 61 -->in Parliaments, My advice is you forfeit none, but for ſuch odious crimes, as may make them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ever to be restored again.</hi> And in the ſame Book, ſpeaking of the High-landers and their Oppreſſions, he ſubjoyns this good counſel to his Son, <hi>Put in Execution the Laws made againſt the Over-Lords, and Chieffs of their Claims, and it will be no difficulty to daunton them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The reſtoring of this Family would prove a dangerous Preſident to encourage rebellious and Traiterous ſpirits, to perpetrate ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid crimes, as the late <hi>Argyle</hi> did, upon hopes, that whatſoever Treaſons they commit, their Families and Poſterity may ſtill ſtand: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as upon the contrary, the exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eradicating of this Family, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at this firſt happy appearance of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties juſtice) will be a Scar-crow to all others, and ſerve as a Beacon, to make them ſhun the rocks of Rebellion, which they know will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſhip wrack not only themſelves, but alſo their poſterity. In confirmation whereof it was obſerved that the late <hi>Argyle</hi> when he received his ſentence, was more moved at that part, which touched the ruine of his Poſterity and Family, then for what concerned his own perſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151737:4"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 62 -->
            <p n="5">5. The reſtoring of the Son would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to many of his Majeſties loyal Subjects of the beſt quality, and to divers Orphans and Widows, who have been oppreſt and almoſt ruined by the Father; and can expect no other reparation of their loſſes, but from the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſaid eſtate; unleſſe his Majeſty would put himſelf to unneceſſary charges, to repair them ſome other way.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The reſtoring of this Family is not only dangerous and inconvenient for the aforeſaid general reaſons, but alſo for the ſaid <hi>Archibald</hi> his particular faults and Miſdemeanors; For beſides that <hi>Vice runs much in a bloud,</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> hath obſerved, it's well known that both he and his Brother <hi>Neil</hi> are of the ſame Principles with their Father, who died impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, aſſerting the Covenant, and ſowing the ſeeds of Sedition and Rebellion, and as it were entailing it upon his Children, as appears by his laſt Speech: which bad principles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd in them both with their milk; and to make the elder more compleat, he was ſent abroad to be bred at <hi>Geneva,</hi> with Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from his Father to that Kirk, and to the Presbyterians of <hi>France,</hi> where he kept cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between his Father and them.
<pb facs="tcp:151737:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 62 -->And the younger was lately proved to have been privy and conſenting to all his Fathers treacherous complyances with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to have been actually in Arms with them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The bad principles and inclinations of the elder appeared when his Majeſty retired from St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> with intention to go to ſome of his loyal Subjects in the Northern parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For immediatly upon that news, he rifled his Majeſties Cabinets, and after his Majeſties return, he being Captain of the Guard put a Padlock on his Majeſties door, keeping him as a Priſoner. Which ſufficiently ſhews that he is his Fathers Son.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To evidence further his bad inclinations and averſion from his Majeſties ſervice, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver raiſed Regiment or Company all the time the King was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to joyn with the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army: But a little before his Majeſty was to march into <hi>England,</hi> he eagerly urged that ſome Parties might be drawn out of every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment to make up one for himſelf, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Kings Guard. And though he knew that would be undoubtedly denied him, yet he ſtill perſiſted to preſſe the ſame, on purpoſe to have ſome pretence of diſcontent, that ſo he
<pb facs="tcp:151737:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->might avoid marching into <hi>Engl.</hi> with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Which ſhal be teſtified by ſome who were then privy to his Fathers and his own deſigns.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Though it be pretended for expiation of theſe miſdemeanours, that he appeared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in his Majeſties ſervice in the High-lands, under the Earls of <hi>Glencairne</hi> &amp; <hi>Middleton</hi> his Majeſties Generals; yet that doth no waies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Loyalty, and cannot expiate the leaſt of his faults for divers Reaſons.
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe when he was there, in his uſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes be eagerly aſſerted the Covenant, and juſtified the barbarous death of the renowned Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> his Majeſties General, as he had barbarouſly and ſcandalouſly inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over him, at his Carting and Execution.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe even then he combind with the late Lord <hi>Balcarras,</hi> to divide his Majeſties Forces, by endeavouring to renew and ſet up that <hi>fatal and rebellious Covenant.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured alſo another way to deſtroy thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by uſing all poſſible perſwaſions with the Viſcount of <hi>Kenmure,</hi> to make him uſurp the Generals place, not only without, but againſt the Kings Order. And fearing this unſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full treachery would come out, to ſhun his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment, he immediatly fled away to
<pb facs="tcp:151737:5"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->his Fathers bounds; from whence he wrote Letters, to make ſome chief Gentlemen deſert his Majeſties General, and ſo break his Forces. <hi>And this is all the great Loyalty that ever he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is ſo much brag'd of by his friends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. And that he perſiſted ſtill in the ſame bad inclinations divers years after, appeared lately; For when General <hi>Monck,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle,</hi> was upon his laſt March into <hi>England,</hi> and had made ſome tranſactions with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties loyal Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for promoting his Majeſties happy Reſtoration, the ſaid <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> then dwelling in one of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntlyes</hi> houſes, did not only divert all thoſe under his power, but alſo dealt with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to enter into a Combination with him, and to ſign Bonds, to oppoſe the ſaid Generals Noble and Immortal deſigns.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The reſtoring of the ſaid <hi>Archibald</hi> will be alſo dangerous, for the great ſtore of money that in all probability is left him by his Father, who received great ſummes from the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for all his treacherous and cruel Expeditions againſt his Majeſties loyal Subjects there; and alſo from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; particularly 40 thouſand pound
<pb facs="tcp:151737:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 64 -->Sterling at the delivering up of the King at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> beſides a good ſumme he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after from <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and what he made up by the revenues of two <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> theſe 20 years, by ſeizing the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntlyes</hi> eſtate, and a part of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſſes:</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting divers of his Majeſties few Duties, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Exchequer; by oppreſſing of many Gentlemen his neighbours, and diſpoſſeſſing them of their Eſtates. All which cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to leſſe then a hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound Sterling; which ſumme muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main entire, or little diminiſhed, ſince its known he lived ſparingly, and theſe laſt 20 years he would pay none of his Debts, neither Principals nor Profits. So that his Son having ſuch ſtore of money, is as powerfull as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to do miſchief, if he be reſtored.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Laſtly, As the reſtoring of this Family would be a notable prejudice to many who have been oppreſt by it, and no ſmall grief to his Majeſties loyal Subjects, who juſtly apprehend the dangers that may thence enſue, to his Majeſties prejudice, and diſturbance of the Nation, and would ſtrengthen the hands of his Majeſties enemies, and weaken his friends; ſo it is the only hopes and deſire of thoſe, who have been enemies to his Majeſties Father of bleſſed memory, or who by this means expect the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the rebellious Covenant, ſo deſtructive to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. And therefore that Family in prudence ought not to be reſtored.</p>
